# vessel_eta
This application calculate the ETA (Estimated Time Arrival) of a vessel.

When a vessel depart from a port, it needs to calculate the estimated time to arrive to inform family members of the crew and authorities.

And it's also necessary for them to know whether they are lost or not.

Thinking on that, I created this project to calculate the date based on distance in nautical miles (MN), the date from departed or last position and speed in knots.

Also, the authorities can use to calculate when a vessel will arrive in a port for an approach and inspection.

To improve my abilities, I decided to make this project with Python, that is a Program Language that I'm learning now.

Until now, I used datetime library and its function like datetime and timedelta.
I used strftime and strptime to format the date on Brazilian's date.
